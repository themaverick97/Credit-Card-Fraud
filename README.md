# Credit-Card-Fraud
A credit card is one of the most used financial products to make online purchases and
payments. Though the Credit cards can be a convenient way to manage your finances, they can
also be risky. Credit card fraud is the unauthorized use of someone else&#39;s credit card or credit
card information to make purchases or withdraw cash.
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card
transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
